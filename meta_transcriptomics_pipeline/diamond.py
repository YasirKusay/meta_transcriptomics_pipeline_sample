# explanation of how diamond flags work
# if you are experiencing memory issues, its better to raise the chunks (-c) rather than lower the block size (-b)
# it should not impact the performance too much according to this:
# https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fnmeth.3176/MediaObjects/41592_2015_BFnmeth3176_MOESM5_ESM.pdf
# according to the diamond paper -B refers to the max amount of the index/query sequence letters to load and compare at a time
# -c refers to how many chunks we want to divide an individual seed when processing it 
# also the paper (towards the end) gives a formula for estimating the memory usage
# 2(B + 8 x B/C + const). Hence, for -b 6 and -c 1, the estimated memory usage is 2(6e9 + 8*6e9) = 108 GB expected mem usage
